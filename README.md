### Team 2832's Custom Electronics Breakout Board

The 2015 robot controller replaces the venerable sidecar with a dedicated set of DIO, PWM and Analog pins.  In addition, the controller contains a Custom Electronics Port that can be configured to add additional GPIO to your robot. 

The Custom Electronics Breakout Board provides an easy to use way to access the extended functionality of the NI roboRIO controller.
